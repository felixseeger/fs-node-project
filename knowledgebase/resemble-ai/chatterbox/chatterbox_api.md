## Basic model info

Model name: resemble-ai/chatterbox
Model description: Generate expressive, natural speech. Features unique emotion control, instant voice cloning from short audio, and built-in watermarking.


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text to synthesize (string)
- audio_prompt (optional): Path to the reference audio file (Optional) (string)
- exaggeration (optional): Exaggeration (Neutral = 0.5, extreme values can be unstable) (number)
- cfg_weight (optional): CFG/Pace weight (number)
- temperature (optional): Temperature (number)
- seed (optional): Seed (0 for random) (integer)


## Model output schema

{
  "type": "string",
  "title": "Output",
  "format": "uri"
}

If the input or output schema includes a format of URI, it is referring to a file.

### Example (https://replicate.com/p/g7r2drc7psrmc0cqckasg1z4ec)

#### Input

```json
{
  "seed": 0,
  "prompt": "We're excited to introduce Chatterbox, our first production-grade open source TTS model. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.\n\nWhether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life. It's also the first open source TTS model to support emotion exaggeration control, a powerful feature that makes your voices stand out. Try it now on our Hugging Face Gradio app.\n\nIf you like the model but need to scale or finetune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (link).

> 
> # Tips
> - **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
>   - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg=0.5`) work well for most prompts.
>   - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.
> 
> - **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
>   - Try lower `cfg` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
>   - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.
